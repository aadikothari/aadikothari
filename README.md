# Aadi Kothari 🚗
My name is Aadi and I am a graduate student pursuing my interests in the Automated Driving domain with a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech 🧑‍🎓. I have a soft spot for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Automated Driving Software (ADS) as I truly believe in a world with Zero Crashes, which is achievable with the recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence 🛑.

While at Virginia Tech 🦃, I have had the pleasure of leading the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Team 🚦 that participates in the EcoCAR EV Challenge Competition ⚡. I have also served as a Software Engineering Intern for General Motors in their Automated Driving and Active Safety team 🛻, accelerating autonomous vehicle validation and leading novel image processing methods 🚘. My past work at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute and the Department of Energy is also a testament to my passion for the field 🏢, and I will continue to make an impact on the world through my hard work 🤲.
