My name is Aadi and I am a graduate student pursuing my interests in the Automated Driving domain with a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech. I have a soft spot for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Automated Driving Software (ADS) as I truly believe in a world with Zero Crashes, and it is achievable with the recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence. During my time at Virginia Tech, I have had the pleasure of leading the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Team that participates in the EcoCAR EV Challenge Competition. I have also served as a Software Engineering Intern for General Motors in their Automated Driving and Active Safety team, accelerating autonomous vehicle validation and leading novel image processing methods. My past work at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute and the Department of Energy is also a testament to my passion for the field, and I will continue to make an impact on the world through my hard work.
